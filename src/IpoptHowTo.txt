FuncLib comes with pre-compiled Ipopt binaries embedded in the Visual Studio
project. The included files are the 32 bit version. If you want to the 64 bit
version (or any other version), replace the DLLs in the FuncLibIpopt project
folder with a new set of files. Pre-compiled binaries may be found here:

The DLLs are automatically copied to the output folder of any project
depending on FuncLibIpopt.
